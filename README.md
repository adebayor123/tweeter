## Tweeter
A Twitter clone application with CRUD functionality through Django REST framework.
 
## Motivation
As a person who believes that technology is the major platform for human interaction and socialization, I dream to build a platform where people can interact and communicate their ideas, free from government control.
Before doing so, I wanted to learn about **what** really makes social media platforms so successful and have more hands-on full stack development experience.
<br>As a result, I decided to build this project while following this awesome course: https://www.udemy.com/course/tweetme-django/.
