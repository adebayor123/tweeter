## Tweeter
A Twitter clone application with CRUD functionality through Django REST framework.
 
## Motivation
As a person who believes that technology is the major platform for human interaction and socialization, I wish to build a platform where people can interact and communicate their ideas, free from government control.
Before doing so, I wanted to learn about **what** really makes social media platforms so successful and have more hands-on full stack development experience.
<br>As a result, I decided to build this project while following this awesome course: https://www.udemy.com/course/tweetme-django/.

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- [Django](https://https://www.djangoproject.com/)
- [AJAX and JQuery](https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/)
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/)
- [CI/CD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CI/CD)

## Features
Basic Twitter functionalities such as:
1. Sign up & Login
2. Creating Tweets (text only)
3. Follow Other Users
4. Like Tweets

Without signing up, you can search tweets and users, but you will not be able to see the user details.<br>
You can register, or use the following credentials:
